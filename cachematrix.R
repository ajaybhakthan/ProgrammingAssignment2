## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to

##set the value of the matrix
##get the value of the matrix
##set the value of the inverse
##get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setSolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
        getSolve <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setSolve = setSolve,
             getSolve = getSolve)
}


##The following function calculates the mean of the special "vector" created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the mean has already been calculated. If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.
## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getSolve()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setSolve(m)
        m
}
